###### Opinions...
<hr />
* Avoid using the shorthand for complex grids, makes reading layouts with fresh eyes more difficult
* CSS Grid tools in the browser are extremely helpful, Firefox currently has the best grid inspector
* Watch out for syntax - e.g. strings in 
```javascript
grid-template-area: 
  "header header"
  "main sidebar";
  "footer footer";
``` 
but areas NOT in quotes in 
```javascript
grid-area: header;
```
