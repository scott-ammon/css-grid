###### Alert: My Opinions...
<hr />
* Avoid using the shorthand for complex grids, as it makes reading a layout with fresh eyes more difficult
* CSS Grid inspectors in the browser are extremely helpful in learning and working with these layouts, especially Firefox
* Some syntax is quirky - e.g. strings for grid-areas in grid-template-area but not in quotes in grid-area
